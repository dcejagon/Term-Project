# Term Project Proposal 
### Description 
For our project, we are proposing a 2.5 axis plotter that will be similar to 
the first example listed in the term project details. This will use a rotating
arm, with the actual pen extending out on the arm. This fulfils the requirement 
for the plotter to be non-rectilinear. In addition, This plotter should be
relatively low cost ~$15 per person. We intend to use materials commonly used
in 3D printing like Aluminum T-Slot extrusion and V-Slot bearings. 
The initial bill of materials and estimated cost breakdown is seen below. 
Items that have a "-" in the cost column are parts that we have access to 
with no cost. Our main source for parts will be Amazon to eliminate 
shipping costs. Team members have access to 3D printers, which will be used 
to fabricate custom parts such as mounting plates at no additional cost.
