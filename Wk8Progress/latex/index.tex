\hypertarget{index_sec_intro}{}\doxysection{ME 405 Term Project Wk8 Progress Check}\label{index_sec_intro}
This is our project main page for the ME 405 plotter project, and the progress we have made up to this point on the software side of the project.

Our Source Code Repository can be found\+: \hypertarget{index_sec_lb1}{}\doxysection{Task Diagram and File Structure}\label{index_sec_lb1}
We developed the Task Diagram seen below to demonstrate the file structure that we plan to use in our 2D plotter. Each of the files will have some combination of shares and/or queues in order to allow for variable data to be shared between files. We will utilize this by using the Task\+\_\+\+Shares.\+py file that we have been provided to ensure the variables are set up correctly. In addition, we plan to have the differnet tasks communicate with eachother using the structure outlined in previous labs and by using Co\+Tasks.\+py to make sure we are taking advantage of cooperative multitasking.

\hypertarget{index_sec_lb2}{}\doxysection{FSM for each task}\label{index_sec_lb2}
Below we have imagees of the finite state machine (FSM) we plan to use for some of our tasks. Many of these have just two states, \char`\"{}\+On\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Off\char`\"{} but the transitions unique to each task is shown below.
